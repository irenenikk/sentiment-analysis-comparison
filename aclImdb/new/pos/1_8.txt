Saw this last night with my wife, who needed some cheering up after a tough week. This wouldn't have been my pick, but once I saw the cast and the Christmas vibe I thought 'why not?' Another draw was that Paul Feig directed it. Who doesn't love Bridesmaids?! It follows a down and out type character played by Emilia Clarke, who plays it pretty much to perfection. I'm not that familiar with her, but she really bears her soul here. The film balances comedy and drama skillfully, I won't go into too much detail, but the audience here in Australia was laughing out loud throughout and my wife and I had tears by the end.

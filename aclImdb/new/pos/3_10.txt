Now, where to begin... Pretty much everything I feel about this film has been mentioned here before. But boy did it make me FEEL, from the opening credits right through the end credits. It made my heart soar and sink with its colours, scenery, music, and above all else its acting. The phenomenon that is Chalamet was yet unknown to me, and Hammer I'd only seen in a bad chickflick, so it would be an understatement to say I was pleasantly surprised by how they performed. There's so much detail as well, from the inquisitive and knowing looks of a mother, to the picturesqueness of a ladder against the fruittree. Everything about this film draws you in. If I could dream up memories of a hot Italian summer in a rural hamlet, this would be it, I swear I could almost smell and taste this film. Luca Guadagnino made a masterpiece here and I highly doubt it will ever be surpassed in its category.

The movie overall felt like it is able to depict the very essence of young love. it is able to convey the passion, the rawness, the recklessness that one could face when they're in love and just discovering themselves without being overall as shove those ideas down the audience's throats. The music was magnificent, it was wonderfully crafted, but some of the editing concerning the music in the film, made it felt as if they abruptly dropped everything, and kind of destroyed the mood that they were already setting in their previous scenes. The cinematography is amazing, it felt very personal, and throughout the whole movie, i felt like the way that they presented the movie have been mostly consistent

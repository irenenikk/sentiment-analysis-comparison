I was almost not going to see this movie because of the rating! I'm so glad I decided to give it a go because I would've regretted it. This movie is great and I dont even like Christmas romance comedies! It wasnt overly sappy and filled with sex scenes like the regular theater movies and even with people spoiling the "plot twist" it was still well worth the watch! The storyline is very simple but nothing wrong with a little simplicity. Not all movies should be unpredictable. Predictable doesn't mean unsatisfying. I find the more UNpredictable the movie, the less satisfying because who wants to watch a whole bunch of random scenarios happen in one movie? Not this girl. That would be wAY too much.

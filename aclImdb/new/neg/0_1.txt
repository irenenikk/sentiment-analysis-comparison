Anyone who says this movie is good (or even worse, great) knows nothing about (good) movies and history (Yugoslavia in 1999? really?? war started in '91.. you cannot even tell if family is Serbian, Croatian or Bosnian..guess it doesnt matter anyway cause actors speak "russian english" nor do people know where Croatia is (but you love Game of thrones, i bet!). I feel like Wikipedia would have done better job writing the screenplay. I wouldnt usually care, (because this was never ment to be new "Godfather" movie) but Kate makes a pretty big deal about being foreign and i cannot believe they didnt back checked everything. (Whats with all political Brexity stuff??) I hate myself for spending time and money on this..

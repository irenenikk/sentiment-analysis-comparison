Im from Croatia and the war ended in '95, not '99 Nonetheless, the writing and the acting is horrible. Plus, Croatians do not speak English like the Russians and that was not Croatian language, except for the father (who is actually Croatian) Also, an African american kid in the choir at the beginning, seriously? Thats so unrealistic because there weren't any African Americans in Croatia back in '99. I would not recommend wasting your time

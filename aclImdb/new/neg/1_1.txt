Never have I seen a more contrived Christmas film this in love with itself. With a terrible plot and bland acting to match and the ridiculous nod on Brexit, this film fails. Also probably one the most predictable plot twists ever, so predictable that literally thousands of people pointed it out after the first trailer. This holiday film will quickly be forgotten.

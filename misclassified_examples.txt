Examples of misclassifications by the doc2vec classifier:

Mixed/contradictory language:
Steve Martin is one of the funniest men alive. 
If you can take that as a true statement, then your disappointment at this film will equal mine. 
Martin can be hilarious , creating some of the best laugh-out-loud experiences that have ever taken place in movie theaters. 
You won't find any of them here.

You've Got Mail works alot better than it deserves to. 
In order to make the film a success, all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars, 
have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits. 
No real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in it's body -LRB- it 's basically a complete re-shoot of The Shop Around the Corner, only adding a few modern twists -RRB-. 
Essentially , it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking. It 's overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy, not to mention very manipulative. 
But oh, how enjoyable that manipulation is.

Neutral rating/no strong feelings:
People burst into singing and dancing, something I hardly ever like. 
But this movie is so infectious. And funny! And entertaining! -LRB- And unlike Evita, 
they only sing when they need to. -RRB- Sure some of the actors may not be great singers, 
but they seems to be having a great time, and so does the audience. That 's all I have to say.
Really , if you think that is going to be a dull movie, you 're probably dead. 
And dead people should not be forced into movie theatres. 
Is Mark Leeper dead ? He said that `` This is an almost ghastly misfire ''. 
The movie is rated R , for * one * use of the word motherf ***** . Rating : *** 1/2 out of ****
